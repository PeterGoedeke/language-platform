# language-platform

A vocabulary builder website. WIP. Intended to allow people to register and login to practise their vocabulary, build vocabulary lists, and do weekly vocabulary challenges.


Authentication is currently setup for development only. Among other things tokens do not expire and therefore last forever, which is far from secure. This will be changed before production.


# Note for potential employers


The api for the database is nearing completion and it contains a working user authorisation and authentication system along with an array of secure endpoints for the client to use and integration with the linguatools api. The client side of the application is not yet near completion and will be built with Vue.js.
